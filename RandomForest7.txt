Random Forest Model

A random forest is an ensemble (i.e., a collection) of un-pruned
decision trees. Ensemble models are often robust to variance and bias.

Random forests are often used when we have large training datasets and
particularly a very large number of input variables (hundreds or even
thousands of input variables). The algorithm is efficient with respect
to a large number of variables since it repeatedly subsets the
variables available. Use the Importance button to view the relative
importance of each variable.

A random forest model is typically made up of tens or hundreds of
decision trees. Use the Errors button to view the rate of decrease of
the model error as the number of trees increases.
