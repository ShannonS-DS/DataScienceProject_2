Score

A model can be deployed on a dataset to obtain scores or
classifications for each observation in the dataset.

By default the testing dataset (if any) will be scored. Otherwise the
training dataset is scored. As an alternative, a CSV file can be
loaded and scored. This choice of what is scored is controlled by the
radio button options.

For binary models a probability score can be recorded. For regression
models a value is recorded for each observation. Otherwise a class
will be recorded for each observation. This can be controlled by the
Class and Probability radio buttons.

The resulting CSV file will include just those variables having a role
as Identifier (plus the Target and the Score), or else all of the
variables.

The name of a CSV file into which the results will be written will be
prompted for.

I need to figure out what are included in these files.
